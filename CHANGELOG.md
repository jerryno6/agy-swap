# Changelog

## 3.1.10

- TUI: add aligned account index column '#' after 'S' in account table matching 'agy-swap switch <index>'.
- TUI: fix colors for 'selected' (Orange) and 'active' (Green) legend indicators in accounts header.

## 3.1.9

- Warm-up: use Gemini 3.8 Flash (Low), resolving the account's advertised model ID and setting low thinking effort for the tiered model.
- Warm-up: send at most one `hi`, validate the generation response, and confirm a decrease in live Gemini 5h quota before reporting success; preserve server quota percentages and reset times.
- Reliability: fail on missing Code Assist projects and token identity mismatches; preserve existing vault credentials when saving refreshed credentials fails.
- CLI/TUI: share structured warm-up results, provide clean JSON and failure exit codes, serialize warm-up with quota refresh, and reject duplicate jobs and stale snapshots.
- Release tooling: accept CRLF metadata files when verifying version consistency.

## 3.1.8

- Settings: configurable auto-next thresholds for 5h window (default 25%) and weekly window (default 15%), renamed to `Auto next interval`.
- TUI: added `R` (Recent Changed) column next to `A` (Active) displaying a yellow dot indicator when an account's quota percentage changed during the most recent refresh.
- Auto-Next: candidate fallback iteration on rotation failure and periodic settings synchronization from CLI into running TUI.
- Security: authoritative secure store validation for macOS Keychain.

## 3.1.7

- TUI: Thêm phím nóng 'w' và command palette action để warm up quota 5h (gửi prompt 'hi' trực tiếp tới Gemini API mà không cần switch active account).
- Security: Sửa lỗi popup macOS Keychain đòi mật khẩu bằng cách loại bỏ cờ '-A' khi lưu credentials.
- TUI: Làm tròn xuống (floor) phần trăm còn lại (%remain) trên cột HEALTH (ví dụ 99.9% hiển thị thành 99%).

## 3.1.6

- TUI: update HEALTH column to display Gemini quota countdown with remaining days/hours (weekly on left, 5h rolling window on right).

## 3.1.5

- TUI: navigate back to dashboard on Escape from subviews (healthcheck/doctor, profiles, settings, history, backup, quota) instead of quitting app.
- TUI: prevent Escape from exiting app on dashboard; only quit on `q`, Ctrl-C, or Ctrl-D.
- Windows: implement proper Win32 console input timeout using `WaitForSingleObject` and key-up event filtering so bare Escape key is recognized without hanging on Windows 11.

## 3.1.4

- TUI: include timestamp in usage refresh status (`Usage refreshed at ddMMyy-hh:mm:ss`).
- Auto-Next: update auto-switch thresholds to trigger when 5h rolling window < 20% or weekly window < 15%.
- Tests: remove obsolete auto-next tests.

## 3.1.2

- TUI: unified release merging upstream v2.11.0 features (partitioned accounts, interactive resizable split view, mouse navigation) with 3.1.x auto-next rotation and portable Windows fixes.

## 3.1.1

- TUI: adjust auto-refresh interval to 300s.
- TUI: merged upstream v2.11.0 features (partitioned accounts into `READY` / `ATTENTION REQUIRED`, interactive resizable split view, mouse divider drag & wheel navigation).
- TUI: auto-next after quota refresh with persistent toggle (`N` / Shift+N).

## 3.1.0

- Local release with the Windows account-switch fixes and portable test suite from 2.10.1.

## 2.11.0

- TUI: partitioned accounts into `READY` and `ATTENTION REQUIRED` sections with warning marker (`⚠`), token health status override, and repair guidance in account detail.
- TUI: interactive split resizing: drag the vertical divider (`│`) with mouse in real time, double-click divider to reset, and navigate accounts via mouse wheel.
- TUI: discoverable split controls with `+`, `-`, `[`, `]`, `alt-left`, `alt-right`, and footer keycaps indicator `[[]/[]] Resize` in wide layout.
- TUI: 0ms vault token check on startup to partition missing vault credentials without waiting for background network quota refresh.
- TUI: wider default left accounts table proportion (46%, min 48 columns) preventing quota meter truncation on standard viewports.

## 2.10.1

- Windows: normalize active-session OAuth credentials to fit Credential Manager, preserving the latest ID token and exact rollback snapshots.
- Windows: reject failed secure-session writes instead of reporting a successful file-only switch.
- Tests: keep POSIX permission assertions platform-aware, validate story rendering without optional site fixtures, and account for unsupported Windows PTY sessions.

## 2.10.0

- TUI: unified operator deck redesign with TrueColor palette engine, rounded container borders (`╭─╮`, `╰─╯`), brand pill header, active capsule, and pill keycaps footer.
- TUI: precision Unicode fractional quota meters (`█ ▉ ▊ ▋ ▌ ▍ ▎ ▏`) with clear track and reset countdown.
- TUI: modern chevron cursor (`❯`) for account selection across stacked and wide views.
- TUI: header displays dev build indicator (`v2.10.0-dev`) when running from local dev installation.

## 2.9.1

- Docs and site: saved account tokens are described as they are stored, in `vault.json` (`0600`, not encrypted), with `AGY_SWAP_VAULT=keychain` for the OS credential store. SECURITY.md no longer claims an encrypted fallback.
- CLI: `doctor` reports where saved tokens are stored; messages, the palette, the help screen, and the first-run note say "the vault" instead of "the OS vault".
- Internal: `internal/app` uses `internal/config` for paths and version checks; unused release-client code is removed.
- Site: the live arc draws as a line with a little sparkle over a faint guide, and the session ring appears only on the switch beat.
- AGY Live (local): the browser terminal shrinks to the TUI's 28x12 minimum.
- Backups: encrypted export reports an encoding error instead of writing empty output.
- Internal: golangci-lint now checks the whole codebase with no baseline; dead helpers are removed.

## 2.9.0

- Site: production runs as one Watchtower-managed container. AGY Live runs only locally on loopback with `make live`, and the site image is built, previewed, and published from the local machine.
- Site: the story, commands, and install band follow one scroll clock, with an arc drawn down the margin on every device and a particle arc in 3D on capable desktops. Wheel scrolling is smoothed while touch and reduced motion stay native.
- Site: one floating glass capsule serves as the navbar on both pages. Cards, panels, dropdowns, and buttons share one radius scale and one set of glass tokens. Buttons use a soft orange gradient with white text, and a quiet backdrop fills the empty background. The AU/BU/GU account coins are gone.
- Site: the dev server picks a free port instead of pinning 5173.
- TUI: narrow quota views keep the reset window (`43% · 2d 4h`) and show account health before the email.
- Site: the browser tab title follows the selected language.
- Docs: a shorter README, plus CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, architecture, and development guides.
- Internal: atomic writes, file locks, and the release-check client moved into `internal/store`, `internal/client`, and `internal/config`. Behavior is unchanged.
- Keep local AI instruction links, planning documents, worktrees, and environment files out of Git while allowing environment examples.
- Stop tracking the previously committed AI implementation plan. Earlier Git history is unchanged.
- Site: story terminals size to the drawn screen, so the hero has no empty strip and the pinned terminal keeps its right border.

## 2.8.8

- TUI: toasts and dialogs keep the frame's side borders instead of blanking whole rows; the success toast sits above the status rule.
- TUI: the quota view labels the selected account once instead of repeating its email above the detail block.
- Site: "How it works" pins one terminal while its three steps scroll past, with a progress rule on the current step. Small or short screens keep each step's frame inline.
- Site: removed decorative filler: the gradient route line, hero glow, gradient headline text, and uppercase eyebrow labels. The independence note moved into the hero footnote.
- Site: the feature list now covers the credential vault, rollback-protected switching, `doctor`, and backups instead of repeating the story. Install uses the same heading-and-content layout, with first-run commands shown as code.
- Site: the AGY Live status dot follows the connection state; terminal key labels, footer copy, and install link text are translated in every language; Thai, Japanese, and Chinese quota and account terms are consistent.
- Site: fixed the skip link peeking out at the top edge, the wordmark using an unloaded font, the install page's smaller wordmark, and low-contrast selected dropdown text in light theme.

## 2.8.7

- Use one accessible dropdown component for the navbar language menu and the system picker on both install surfaces.

## 2.8.6

- Render the hero and three account-flow scenes in the same xterm emulator as AGY Live, using frames produced by the Go TUI instead of HTML/CSS terminal facsimiles.
- Give desktop scenes the native wide two-pane layout, retain native tablet and mobile layouts, and keep the terminal frame fully visible at each size.

## 2.8.5

- Align the full install notes header and page sections with the landing page's 1536px container and responsive gutters. Keep install command content at the same readable width on both pages.
- Refresh the native TUI story frames and social preview for this release version.

## 2.8.4

- Replace the handmade hero preview and three story illustrations with responsive snapshots from the actual Go TUI renderer: account list, quota view, and a completed account switch.
- Keep the snapshots in sync with the release version and native demo data through a deterministic Go fixture test. Add a narrower native layout for 320px screens and refresh the social preview.

## 2.8.3

- Replace the decorative account-card image in the homepage hero with a terminal-style account and quota preview using the demo's sample account values.
- Keep the interactive Go TUI in AGY Live, remove the unused hero image, and refresh the social preview to show the terminal.

## 2.8.2

- Self-host Manrope for Latin text, Noto Sans Thai for Thai text, and JetBrains Mono for technical labels and commands; retain system CJK fallbacks.
- Refine the hero and install heading rhythm for Thai and Japanese, keep the narrowest mobile header within the viewport, and update the social preview to match the new type.

## 2.8.1

- Give the account artwork more vertical space on narrow screens so the privacy note remains clear and unobstructed.

## 2.8.0

- Give Google Antigravity a distinct place in the homepage headline while keeping agy-swap's orange action color and independent-product attribution.
- Connect the hero, account, quota-refresh, switching, live demo, and install sections with a scroll-drawn signal path. Keep the route static and subdued when reduced motion is preferred.
- Move the hero explanation and actions beside the headline, add localized account-to-session chapters, and refresh the social preview for the new layout.

## 2.7.0

- Open AGY Live automatically when its section approaches the viewport. Keep the real, isolated Go TUI visible from the first render, with a retry action if the demo gateway is unavailable.
- Replace the standalone install notes markup with a Vite page that shares the site's language, theme, platform picker, and copyable install commands.
- Add a custom agy-swap wordmark, favicon, and account-switch artwork. Give each homepage scene its own restrained two-depth scroll motion, with a static reduced-motion experience.
- Use a warm white primary action in the dark theme and refine the homepage copy and visual hierarchy around the actual account-switch workflow.

## 2.6.1

- Replace the outdated social preview that showed the removed account picker with the current panorama headline and account artwork. Update the homepage and install page image metadata and dimensions.

## 2.6.0

- Run the actual Go TUI in the browser against isolated, disposable demo accounts. Native keys and mobile key buttons switch the sample session; blocked system actions stay inside the demo.
- Replace the browser-side account picker and generated terminal fixtures with a private WebSocket/PTy gateway and lazy terminal renderer.
- Add layered 2D scroll artwork, retain the typing headline, and update the responsive copy and deployment runbook.

## 2.5.1

Use Vite's default localhost binding for site development so another server bound to localhost cannot take precedence over agy-swap on the same port.

## 2.5.0

Make the website demo a direct, clickable 2D account switcher. Visitors can select a sample account, inspect Accounts or Quota, and switch the simulated local session; the terminal remains available for keyboard exploration. Remove the 3D model, textures, and repeated eyebrow labels. Add a reduced-motion-aware typing title, restrained parallax with generated account/session artwork, and an updated social preview. Review the page against product-specific anti-slop criteria and verify desktop, mobile, and Thai layouts.

## 2.4.1

Fix the guided website demo so the terminal visibly updates to the selected
account after the sample switch. The demo now loads the full dashboard fixture
before applying the switch, including when visitors jump directly to step 3.

## 2.4.0

This release makes the website easier to understand and use on a first visit.

- Explain the account-health and local-session workflow in the hero, search metadata, README, and install notes.
- Add a three-step first-run path from installation to the first account switch.
- Replace the long scroll-driven showcase with three named demo steps and a readable mobile preview. Keep the 3D terminal as an optional desktop view.
- Show one install command at a time for the selected operating system and move advanced methods into troubleshooting.
- Align English, Thai, Japanese, and Chinese interface copy with quota snapshots and explicit refresh behavior.

## 2.3.3

This patch keeps the agy CLI from asking for the macOS login password on every launch.

- Publish the shared `gemini` / `antigravity` session item with `/usr/bin/security add-generic-password -U -A`, the same code identity the agy CLI uses to read it.
- Update that item in place. A delete followed by a create drops Always Allow on the next launch.
- Leave the agy-swap account vault on the in-process Keychain path. That vault is a different item and stays with the agy-swap binary.

## 2.3.2

This patch keeps saved account tokens when the vault file is shared by two processes, when it is corrupt, or when a quota refresh fails.

- Serialize `vault.json` with a cross-process file lock and replace it through the existing atomic write path, including on Windows.
- Refuse to rewrite a vault file that cannot be parsed, so one save cannot erase the other accounts.
- Delete a replaced vault entry only after `accounts.json` has been saved. A failed copy or a failed save leaves the previous secret in place.
- Keep the last quota snapshot when `agy-swap next` cannot refresh an account, so a fresh cache can still be selected.
- Store the refreshed token hash and a non-secret access expiry with the account. The detail pane shows that expiry without reading the vault on every frame.
- Reject a refreshed token whose email does not match the account before the account record is changed.
- Pause the TUI key reader before a suspended login command takes stdin, and leave unread input in the terminal buffer.

## 2.3.1

This patch release permanently eliminates repeated macOS Keychain authorization prompts, cascades of permission dialogs on launch, and orphaned keychain items.

- **Deterministic Secret Refs**: Switched account secret references from randomized nonce strings (`account:<email>:<nonce>`) to stable deterministic refs (`account:<email>`), preserving access authorization across token refreshes and account updates.
- **In-Memory Token Hashing**: Added SHA-256 token hashing (`token_hash`) for active account identification in memory, completely eliminating the startup loop over all managed accounts.
- **Secure File Vault (`0600`) & Hybrid Vault**: Added `fileAccountVault` (`~/.gemini/agy-swap/vault.json` with strict `0600` permissions) and hybrid vault fallback for a 100% zero-prompt experience on macOS matching Antigravity and GitHub CLI standards.
- **Keychain Orphan Cleaner**: Added automatic detection and cleanup of obsolete orphaned keychain items left behind by previous versions in macOS `login.keychain-db`.


## 2.3.0

This minor release introduces interactive split resizing for wide TUI displays, persistent layout preferences, and dynamic account table column expansion.

- Interactive split resizing via keyboard (`[` / `]` or `<` / `>` for fine step, `{` / `}` for large step, and `=` to reset).
- Command Palette actions for widening, narrowing, and resetting the pane split.
- Layout split preference persisted in `settings.json` under `ui.split_offset` and configurable via CLI (`agy-swap config set ui.split_offset <val>`).
- Dynamic account column widths with increased health column cap (up to 32 characters) to prevent text truncation on wider displays.

## 2.2.1

This patch release fixes macOS Keychain secret retrieval and deletion by performing all operations in-process through Security.framework instead of external CLI calls, eliminating repeated OS authorization prompts, and adds automated single-command version bumping.

- Read and delete macOS Keychain secrets directly via Security.framework in-process to align code identity and partition lists with writes.
- Prevent recurring system permission prompts on Darwin caused by `/usr/bin/security` partition list mismatches.
- Add opt-in Keychain probe test for real keychain round-trip verification.
- Add automated single-command version bumping (`make bump` and `scripts/bump-version.sh`) across all code, documentation, and fixture surfaces.
- Add `make install` to compile and install directly into active local CLI path.

## 2.2.0

This minor release adds working account policies, reserve accounts, and directory
binding actions while fixing account storage, backup recovery, quota selection,
and browser demo reliability.

- Detect concurrent account creation and stale account/settings writes. Serialize
  history changes and recover interrupted account/settings imports together.
- Share backup validation across CLI and TUI. Reject malformed encrypted data and
  invalid settings before import; preserve credentials during metadata merges.
  New encrypted backups use PBKDF2-SHA256 and AES-GCM; legacy backups remain readable.
- Combine manual, log, and API cooldowns. Require fresh, known available quota for
  automatic selection. Implement sticky, balanced, and round-robin policies,
  profile reserves, notification thresholds, and prompt/recommend/auto bindings.
- Verify new account identity through Google userinfo, persist refreshed OAuth
  credentials even when quota retrieval fails, repair session files on switching,
  and record successful switches. Restore prior sessions when login fails.
- Write macOS credentials through Security.framework without secret process
  arguments. Report plaintext fallback when the OS vault is unavailable.
- Correct family quota metrics, unknown statusline values, refresh behavior,
  child exit codes, and concurrent log attribution. JSON errors exit nonzero.
- Preserve UTF-8 input and letter case in forms; fix Tab and Shift-Tab navigation.
- Verify release asset contents against checksums, prevent unintended downgrades,
  test downloaded binaries before installation, and roll back failed replacement.
- Preserve manual demo navigation during scrolling and ignore stale async loads.
  Pack 51,114 renderer fixtures into shared rows/frames and fit the 3D terminal on
  mobile screens. Update all four site translations and storage claims.
- Consolidate site packaging around Docker/Nginx and local release tooling.

Existing account files and legacy encrypted backups remain supported. Automatic
selection now fails when no account has verified fresh capacity; use an explicit
`switch ACCOUNT` when intentionally overriding that safeguard. OS credential vault
failure can leave tokens in local plaintext files with restricted permissions;
Antigravity's own session files also contain credentials. Backups with secrets
must be encrypted. Older vault entries are retained for backup recovery.
